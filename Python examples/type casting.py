# type casting = convert the data type of a value to another data type

# x = 1  # int
# y = 2.0  # double
# z = "3"  # str

# int(y)
# type cast y from double to int / not permanent change
# y = int(y)
# permanent change from double to int due to variable passing

# print("x is  "+ str(x))
# converts x to str data type and allows string interactions
